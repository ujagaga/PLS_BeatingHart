# PLS Beating Hart #

This is a computer casing for our medical clinic. An Orange Py 5 is used as a desktop computer and placed in this plastic casing with two servo motors to make it look like it is beating. There is also an OLED display on the power button to show when it is working.

I soldered a couple of wires to the OrangePi5 built in power button, so I could attach an external one. The 3D model is built using FreeCad and printed on a 3D printer.

The servos used are SG90.

The OLED LCD is a 128x64 pixel 0.96" I2C display.

The pls_hart_speed.sh can set different speed 1-5 like:
